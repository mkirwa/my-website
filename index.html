    My name is Mahlon Kirwa and I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering at Claflin University. Throughout my life in college I have developed paramount skills in computer science such as learning python, html and css, Java, and am currently doing ruby, data structures and algorithms and learning  with Harvard at ed x. I am passionate about programming and I am willing to learn new concepts all the same. I have enhanced my leadership skills as I am currently the president of International Student Association at Claflin University. As a Residential Assistant, I have been able to co-ordinate well with my peers and managers in enhancing service delivery to residents of SRC south. Summer Institute of Emerging Managers and Leaders at UC davis California and my three credit hours honor's  leadership classes have magnified my  leadership skills. Besides, I have 105 community service hours. I have a certificate in radiation safety from University of South Carolina. That makes me certified in radiation safety, United States. My major goal is to utilize my skills in programming and developing new concepts and ideas in respect of the growing inventions in the computing field.
